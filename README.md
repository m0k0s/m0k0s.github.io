This is a fun website based on open source, publicly available data from Public Citizen's Global Trade Watch's Chinese Investment in the United States database. The data used in this project is available here: https://www.citizen.org/chinese-corporate-investment-database
I will periodically update this with additional visualizations derived from publicly available data on related topics so that I can practice my burgeoning pandas, python, and web development skills.
